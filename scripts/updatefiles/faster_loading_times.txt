hey hud goers!

every mod you have that's not in a vpk is really bad for loading times
tf2 checks every file it loads to see if it exists in each folder in custom
this is obviously a pretty long process with lots of folders in custom

vpk's have the advantage of having a list of all files within them
so only files inside the vpk are checked and loaded

TO TURN THIS HUD INTO A VPK
install all fonts (fonts dont load from vpk's but do from installed fonts)
drag _MagnumHUD over /steamapps/common/team fortress 2/bin/vpk.exe
move the _MagnumHUD folder out of custom into custom_disabled or something

keep in mind you'll have to vpkify every update
